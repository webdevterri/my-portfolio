What was my thought process when designing my website?

I didn't want my site to look like every other modern, ultra-minimalist site that mobile-first design seems to have birthed. You know the look: large sections with mostly negative space, obligatory hero section with an image or video, unneccesary carousel, side-by-side cards, etc. 

Do all sites have to look like they were designed by the same person? So many sites today are not that memorable. 

For large screens, I wanted the information to be presented on a single page, completely above the fold, so I used 100vh (100% viewport height). Of course, this wouldn't make sense on small (mobile) screens so I simply stacked the boxes vertically and made a few minor tweaks to the header.

Instead of a bright, white background I opted for a dark mode (dark gray background) with a high contrast of white for fonts and other elements like borders and icons.

Growing up in the 90s and learning to code websites on free hosts like Geocities and Angelfire, I'm a bit nostalgic for the web 1.0 aesthetics but didn't want to completely offend the modern senses so I met in the middle. 

The boxes are reminiscent of the 90s webpages with their many parts on a single page, crammed with information (which you can actually still see in action on Japanese web pages!) 

But I wanted to tone it down a bit so I stuck to using two colors and trying to balance things out a little more using a grid-like pattern, versus using loud backgrounds and as many colors as I possibly could.

I used Tailwind CSS for this project.
